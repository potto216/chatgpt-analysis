# chatgpt-analysis
Interesting conversations I have collected using ChatGPT. I think this is an exciting opportunity to see how the GPT-3 and GPT-4 language models can be used as a tool to complete our goals.

In the conversations my notation is:
* I have highlighted in bold interesting parts of ChatGPT's answers. 
* My conversations start with `<me>` and ends with `</me>`
* ChatGPTs conversations start with `<chatgpt>` and ends with `</chatgpt>`
* Interesting parts of ChatGPTs conversations I have **bolded**
* Commentary I have start with `<commentary>` and ends with `</commentary>`
